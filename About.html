<h1><font color="white"> About GROMA </font></h1>
<p> <font color="white">We at GROMA are determined to provide the nation a whole new world of opportunities, so we "The 3 Aces" have initiated this project to uplift the the real indian businessmen community
   known as 'sabjiwalas'or'rehriwalas'who sell their grocery stock by going street to street and various markets and this all takes a lot of hardwork and its pretty much exhaustive, so we have
   decided to make an online platform where the commonm business can bring his rehri digitally to the whole new and never before everchanging era of digitalisation of the nation</font>
</p>
<br>
<p> <font color="white"
>Unlike other online grocery seller, we do not have any inventory based model or any other model which only considers the well off shops of the town and still the little businessmen are ignored, they still have to roam in the streets and in various markets and streets for the whole day
and too many grocery carts in the market tend to create chaos on the roads and the markets and then the authorities also blame them for all this chaotic process which takes place on daily basis on a very large scale in each and every part of the country wether it is a metropolitan city,a town or the villages.

so we at Groma are determined to provide the small businessmen a chance to bring a change in their daily business life by sitting home away from the harsh and scorching sun out ther, or they can do any other work for the day while grocery stock will be sell online to the nerabout customers and hence they will be able improve their family's financial status
and hence bringing out everlasting positive changs in the indian community. </font>
